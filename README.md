In off-road environments, some problems like insufficient consideration of environmental trafficability, difficulty in model convergence, limited generalization, and poor dynamic obstacle avoidance ability often exist in autonomous mobile robot (AMR) path planning research based on reinforcement learning (RL). In order to solve these problems, a distributed proximal policy optimization dynamic path planning algorithm based on experience playback enhancement (Re-DPPO) is proposed, which realizes the safe, feasible and optimal trafficability path planning of AMR between any starting and ending points in off-road environment.And the Re-DPPO algorithm is compared with three representative DRL algorithms of PPO, DPPO and deep Q-network (DQN).The above file contains the Python code for PPO, DPPO, DQN, and RE-DPPO algorithms, as well as the AMR trafficability map of the study area.
